    <ul>
    <li>some of the points on the learning curves are very negative so i had to use plt.ylim . whats the reason for this ?</li>
    <li>what data cleaning \ pre processing can be used to improve the model ?</li>
    <li>why do i get noisy learning curve - in particular the one for test ?</li>
